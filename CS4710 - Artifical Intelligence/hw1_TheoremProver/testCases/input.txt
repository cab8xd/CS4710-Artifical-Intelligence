OH Questions:
* Ask about NOTs output and implementation 
* Ask about inputs/tests/submissions syntax (including stdin line)
* Ask about code citation
* Anything else to watch out for?
* keep track of truth values, can be very similar to query.

!T
I KNOW THAT NOT T

!T&B
I KNOW THAT T
I KNOW THAT B
THUS I KNOW THAT NOT T AND B

B
where !T -> B
I KNOW THAT T
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT NOT B I KNOW THAT T

!T&B&C
I KNOW THAT T
I KNOW THAT B
I KNOW THAT C
THUS I KNOW THAT T AND B <-- nots just reserved for end or put it at this conclusion too?
THUS I KNOW THAT NOT T AND B AND C
